Program Description: JavaScript Quiz Game

This JavaScript quiz game is designed to test a user's knowledge of JavaScript and web development concepts. It's an interactive quiz that presents a series of multiple-choice questions to the user. The user's goal is to answer the questions correctly and achieve a high score.

Key Features:

Quiz Questions: The program defines a set of quiz questions, each with a question statement, multiple answer choices, and the correct answer.

Shuffle Questions: Before starting the quiz, the program shuffles the order of the questions to ensure that each user gets a different sequence of questions.

Timer: A timer is displayed to the user, initially set to 60 seconds. The user must answer all questions within this time limit.

Start Button: The user begins the quiz by clicking the "Start" button.

Question Display: Questions are displayed one at a time. The user selects their answer from the available choices.

Answer Validation: When the user selects an answer, the program checks if it's correct. If correct, the user's score increases; otherwise, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer.

Progression: The user progresses through the questions until they've answered all of them or the timer runs out.

Result Display: After completing the quiz or when the timer runs out, the program displays the user's score, showing how many questions they answered correctly out of the total.

High Scores: The program allows the user to submit their score, usually in the form of initials, and stores it in a list of high scores. The high scores are sorted, and the user's score is displayed alongside the top scores.

Modal for Initials: A modal dialog is used to input the user's initials before submitting the score.
